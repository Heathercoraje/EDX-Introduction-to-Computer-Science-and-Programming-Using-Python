This course aims to help students learn computational models of thinking and the art of computational problem solving by using a language called python.

This course is free course offered by EDX MIT. Yet it's estimated learning hours can be heavy, which is 15 hours per week for 9weeks, the course is known to be one of legendary open classes in Computer Science and programming.

This repo aims to share solutions of each exercise as the class goes to repeat the cycle of understanding & practicing.
The course suggests to use Anaconda package manager to use python3 and spyder as IDE along with python library numpy and matplotlib.
