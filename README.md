# EDX:MITx: 6.00.1x:Introduction-to-Computer-Science-and-Programming-Using-Python

This course aims to help students learn computational models of thinking and the art of computational problem solving by using a language called python. This course is a free course offered by EDX MIT. It's estimated learning hours can be heavy, which is 15 hours per week for 9 weeks yet this course is known to be one of legendary open classes in Computer Science and programming.

This repo aims to recap fundamental concepts in basic programming and to share solutions of exercises within a cycle of understanding & practicing. Personally, this course can benefit graduates from fast-pace learning coding bootcamps as the cornerstone of further learning.

The course suggests to use Anaconda package manager to use python3 and spyder as IDE along with python library numpy and matplotlib.
