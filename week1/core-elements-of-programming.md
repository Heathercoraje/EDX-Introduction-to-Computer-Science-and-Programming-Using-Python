# Core elements of programming
It is important not to lose bindings because once lost, you cannot get it back.
Therefore, in such case, one can use a new variable temp to store a value

### Exercise 1
By using ```+``` strings can be concatenated.
Also, one uses ```[]``` to print out char in a specific index
+ ```3 * "bc"``` return ```bcbcbc```
+ ```"3" * "bc"``` return ```error```
+ ```"abcd"[2]``` returns ```c``` (return 2 index only)
+ ```"abcd" [0:2]``` returns ```ab``` (from 0 until the 2 index)
+ ```"abcd" [2:]``` returns ```cd``` (from 2 until the end)
