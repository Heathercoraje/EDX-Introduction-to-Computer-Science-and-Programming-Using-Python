# Week 1: Python Basics > 1. Introduction to Python

### Exercises 1
+ The difference of an algorithm and a program is that an algorithm is conceptual idea and a program is an concrete instantiation of algorithm
+ A computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas
+ Computer Science is not just about building efficient machines to run programs.
+ Remembering results and performing calculation are two things that every computer can do   

### Exercise 2
+ Declarative knowledge refers to statements of fact
+ Imperative knowledge refers to 'how-to' of methods
+ without a recipe for solving a problem given, a computer cannot generate one on it's own

With a simple set of primitives, one should be able to compute anything. Yet modern programming languages have more convenient set of primitives and also one can abstract methods to create new primitives(note that this is where a power of computational thinking comes in).

Turing complete means equivalent in power to a universal tuning machine which says anything you can compute in one language can be compute in any other.

### Exercise 3
+ A fixed program computer is designed to compute precisely one computation
+ A stored program computer is designed to run any computation, by interpreting a sequence of instructions that are read into it
+ A program counter points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program
+ Computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the s equence
+ There are 6 primitives but with modern programming language, one can create primitives by abstracting methods

### Exercise 4
+ syntax: is this string legal?
+ static semantic: does this string has a meaning?
+ semantic: assigning a meaning to a legal statement

**Type**
There are different type of object(Data) and they are int, float, boolean and nonetype. While performing operations, when inputs are integers then result is always int. If either or both numbers are floats then result is always float.

### Exercise 5
Int means integer (ex.3), float means floating number (ex.3.33) and boolean is either true or false. Lastly, python has a nonetype object which is ```none```.
### Exercise 6 & Exercise 7
The questions are of simple calculation.

**Variables**
By using assignment ```=``` one assign a value to a variable.
By storing value as a variable, one can reuse it later without doing calculation
