# Week 1: Python Basics > 1. Introduction to Python
## Exercises 1
+ The difference of an algorithm and a program is that an algorithm is conceptual idea and a program is an concrete instantiation of algorithm
+ A computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas
+ Compueter Science is not just about building efficient machines to run programs.
+ Remembering results and performing calculation are two things that every computer can do   
## Exercise 2
+ Declarative knowledge refers to statements of fact
+ Imperative knowledge refers to 'how-to' of methods
+ without a recipe for solving a problem given, a computer cannot generate one on it's own

With a simple set of primitives, one should be able to compute anything. Yet modern programming languages have more convenient set of primitives and also one can abstract methods to create new primitives(note that this is where a power of computational thinking comes in).

Turing complete means equivalent in power to a universal tuning machine which says anything you can compute in one language can be compute in any other.
